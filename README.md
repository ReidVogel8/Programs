# Program descriptions
Here are just some of my programs that exemplify what I've learned and what they do.

spellChecker - While this is a simple program, a user is asked for one word which is then spell checked. The end result includes printing out whether the word they picked was spelled correctly. However, if the word is misspelled the 10 closest words to the spelling will be provided. The correct spelling for the words are provided using a word.txt file which contains almost all words. There are some exceptions, which in return will claim a false spelling. Having a more extensive word.txt file would solve this issue.

graphWork - In this program I calculate different parts of a graph that was created from a txt file. In this file, different actors and the movie they stared in are given. I use Kruskal's algorithm to find the shortest path between two different actors via corosponding movies just like the Oracle of Bacon. There are other options the user is given just as finding the Minimum Spanning Tree of the graph.
