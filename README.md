# Program descriptions
Here are just some of my programs that exemplify what I've learned and how exactly they work.

spellChecker - While this is a simple program, a user is asked for one word which is then spell checked. The end result includes printing out whether the word they picked was spelled correctly. However, if the word is misspelled the 10 closest words to the spelling will be provided. The correct spelling for the words are provided using a word.txt file which contains almost all words. There are some exceptions, which in return will claim a false spelling. Having a more extensive word.txt file would solve this issue.
